  box3Desc:
    "Unlike other third-party component building methods, Quark components do not rely on front-end frameworks, and do not need to be updated with technology stack updates.",
  whatDesc1:
    "Quarkc (Quark core) is a brand new way of building components. Traditional component frameworks such as Antd and Vant need to do a lot of work in the browser, but Quarkc puts these tasks into the compilation phase of building applications.",
  whatDesc2:
    "The data modification of the component is handled by the browser's own API, which is simpler and more efficient!",
